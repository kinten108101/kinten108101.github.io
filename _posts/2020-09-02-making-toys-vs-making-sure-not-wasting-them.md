In some ways or another, this serves as an introduction to my probably first static site. The day when I'm writing this however has been particularly laboring, me dragging my as* off destinations to another, so I'll make this quick.

My dabbling with site-making has not been fruition. Despite self-acclaiming as a blogger, I've barely made enough for a month; then as a scifi-writer, the genre I've known but fell pale in comparison to my peer. There have been 

I don't write much, for the moment keys are typed I'll forever keep failing at my words, so much so that deep in my cranium there's a "cerebral cavity", literal or not. Reading is one thing - the one activity taken for granted, with me jotting down any possible collocations or word combinations, but becoming effluent is another. My every aspect lacks practice, for the only spare time boils down to infinite scrolling and compulsion loops, redundancies that have plagued my unbecoming childhood and to this day. Nighttime is preferable as the mere thought of opening an app triggers every exhaustion, anxiety and

Essentially, the initially registered concept of an English major is a pure one - so that I could write more. Following were the last straws, and I panned out realizing one year later that there exists some who are just as devoted as I were, except that I'd left my own race a long time ago. My mental development and maturity ground to an indefinite halt, and so do my skills. Incidentally, this accounts more my lack of update on the #PROJECT-WATER as I call it. The foundation is great, and the on-paper girders and structures for worldbuilding stand there only beside the piling stacks of work and compulsive delays. Those who know me well enough could see how this spells trouble: I'm volatile at work and demands. If it's unfinished, it never will. The old drafts for my first story fell prey to this malpractice, among others.

Yet, there's more. The original 925weblog was great, but it lacked customization. In fact, no one beside amateur shopkeepers should bother fiddling with it. Wordpress.org makes itself the obvious upgrade in every possible way, yet the setup proves costly, and further is the existential dread of using its user-made static site generators, all of which bugged only on my machine. So I opted for Jekyll, and ever since a day hadn't gone by without me slowly chopping off somebody else's template, transforming toys of my own desire and by that, splashing out on my remote breaks.
