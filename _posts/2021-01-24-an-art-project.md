To be accurate, it's one for literature, and I solely seek to share this because the three (four) agonizing days I have spent on this in place of other interests have certainly taken a toll on my already frailing body, with a constant and unforgiving need to either nod off or sneeze, the latter was accompanied by a runny nose. (I could have taken on some badminton, but at home I rarely have company). Those issues aside, I've taken great delight in drawing with the aid of Photoshop and a barebone Huion drawing tablet. 

The main lifesaver I must highlight was the overpowered feature that is Smart Object. By default, Photoshop's Timeline panel, which enables anim

ating, is quite underwhelming, a tad less intuitive than the likes of Macromedia Flash. You either do with frame animation - and by frame, I mean layer, which means that for any amount of distinct frames in a video an equal number of distinct layers is needed - or video timeline, whose support for many edits and transformations is non-existent. Thankfully there was still Smart Object, and the trick here is to go *outside-in.* Turn the most basic shape of the object into a Smart Object, animate on that whole, then edit the content of the Smart Object itself by either adding details or more nuanced animations, then repeat this step on smaller details. Thanks to this the whole project became manageable and if not decluttered.
