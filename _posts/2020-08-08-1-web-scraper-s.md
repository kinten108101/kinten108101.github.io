A few days ago while my inventory was in desparate needs of quality writing content, I stumbled upon Liz's IELTS website which generously offered a plurarity of viable studying material in the forms of task 2 questions (not model asnwers). Still, despite her good intentions, reading them was a labor of its own in that each was *laboriously* categorized in pertinent topics of *separate posts*, which should not cause much obstruction until I came in: a walking archiver tracing every path, nuance, every niches and corners of his study (except writing 101s, yes). 

In previous attempts, including that one time where a pirated books dispersed across a civilized discussion thread, that everything must be dragged and copied painstakingly was inevitable, but in light of my coding progress, a funny thought was caught on. 

*Let Python do the rest*.

This is a remarkable feat by no means. Yahoo! Pipes first drove APIs home in the early 2000s, then got executed. Today, Node-red dominates all budding crossovers between Arduino and APIs, but behind them all lies the backbone programming language Python, not to mention the server environment in its aid, NodeJS. Plenty of applications, programming interfaces are ready-made and open sources already, so only some coding skills are required to, well, interface between them. We've seen Michael, Cary, Dani, et cetera - you name it - making good uses out of them every once in a while. Now it's my turn.
