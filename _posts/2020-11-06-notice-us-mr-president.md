excerpt: "POV: The presidential election is coming to a close, and the charged
  atmosphere rages on as a foreign audience too, a black sheep, joins in the
  seating. Their teeth grind as the electoral college keeps on numbering. Then,
  they imagine, the moment a rising tide comes, they will grab it with dire
  breaths the light at the end of the tunnel - they will, if it succeeds, be
  saved from the overwhelming opposing force that is the greatest of all evils.
  Or so they think."

"Stop the count," a man voiced out as his victory narrowed. Being unenfranchised for such a world-changing  event, I could only watch from afar as the rat race dragged on until its final hours, after which the world would remain unhinged, except for my mental health. 

I've long grown dissatisfied with the prevailing state of affairs. Practically, I would endorse it that the presidential election of the world's greatest nation, to put it wildly, should be of all our concern. The United States governs, or at least partially dictates, the trading of many nations. Its political stance, coupled with unrivaled military prowess, means that its alliance should be worth aiming for. Few aspects of quality life do Americans fail to live up to also. And with that we, the outsiders, cherish the American dream. But whatever the definition goes, the going of Vietnam proves that the values held by such aspiration extend beyond personal fulfillment. In Vietnam, America does not merely stands for success like in others. Instead, we dream security and protection against our common enemy.
