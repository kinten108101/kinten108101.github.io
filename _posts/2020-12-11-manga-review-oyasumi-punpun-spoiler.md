excerpt: "Love and tragedy, that no one could be happy forever. Still, it's the
  decision to never settle that drives us forward. As part of an unfiddled-with
  layer of depth that is in Oyasumi Punpun, I may as well explore my fresh
  impression and one own interpretation of this 150-chaper series, which I
  sped-run in 4 days. "

1. Can't delay a product, or else it will ultimately suffer  2. My English sucks to the point of embarrassment, so swift practices are essential in keeping my spirits running  3. Yes, raising my spirits, the linguistic one  4. Haven't weblog for a while. Seriously as a self-proclaimed blogger my title is subject to questions  5. Want a challenge before the official test  6. I never read manga.  7. My last book review got a shit-show score  8. Really, anything that I've done of late lack quality, mainly due to the fact that a. the product got rushed and b. i didn't try to stretch my heart enough to embrace the material.

Seki - follows a life of self-guidance. challenge: distraction, aberration, lack of real ambitions or achievements, assholic acquaintances. advantage: self-growth in endurance and code. To be blunt, his lifestyle was arresting to those who've been chained away for too long. 

Sachi - determined, probably the most rightfully successful character. sympathetic: willingly sacrifice her name and reputation to help others. Even if it was revealed that her sympathy may stem from self-centeredness, glorifying herself and degrading punpun so as to be a guiding figure, the length she goes to to redeem herself serves as her redeeming feature. Honestly I didn't think she deserves much of the criticism, but it shows only more of her critical thinking and care. eccentric and relatable in manners.

a saving figure. Christian Mysticism. Shawshank Redemption. Forrest Gump. Romanticism

(disclaimer, I hate categorizing) (definition here) (FLCL, lll)

NGE?

Yet these figures are far and few between, and in the realistic Japan that is in Goodnight Punpun, they succumb to all sorts of concussions. The same world as in Joker. Interesting, in one of Tanaka's dream sequences, the textbooks that are her betty noires made references to the going state of the world, including politics, science, society, ... all of which were enmeshed into poppycocks.
