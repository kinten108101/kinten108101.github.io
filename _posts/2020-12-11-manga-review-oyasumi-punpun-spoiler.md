excerpt: "(The image is temporal) Love and tragedy, that no one could be happy
  forever. Still, it's the decision to never settle that drives us forward. As
  part of an unfiddled-with layer of depth that is in Oyasumi Punpun, I may as
  well explore my fresh impression and one own interpretation of this 147-chaper
  series, which I sped-run in 4 days. "

1. Can't delay a product, or else it will ultimately suffer  2. My English sucks to the point of embarrassment, so swift practices are essential in keeping my spirits running  3. Yes, raising my spirits, the linguistic one  4. Haven't weblog for a while. Seriously as a self-proclaimed blogger my title is subject to questions  5. Want a challenge before the official test  6. I never read manga.  7. My last book review got a shit-show score  8. Really, anything that I've done of late lack quality, mainly due to the fact that a. the product got rushed and b. i didn't try to stretch my heart enough to embrace the material. 9. I ended up delaying it, so hopefully this is the last time.

"In Abrahamic religions, a messiah or messias is a saviour or liberator of a group of people." Many stories introduce a certain figure as messiah who serves as either a call to adventure or a spur to action, and at first it would ring a bell to followers of romanticism. A messiah, however, is not so strange but still uncommon a figure in realist media,  often portrayed as a disciplined person who breaks with traditions yet also deconstructed to be as flawed as others. 

As a 2009-2013 147-chapter manga series written by manga artist Inio Asano who is known for his hit manga *Solanin*, *Oyasumi Punpun*, translated to *Goodnight Punpun*, has been sitting at 7th in MyAnimeList's Top Manga list; and while it has been praised for anything, not so often the above story-telling motif is concerned. Perhaps due to ubiquity, an ongoing stigma, or perhaps an uninteresting addition to Onodera's life story that relates only to few people like me? To this end, I wish to dive into the life and mindset of this manga's two supporting figures - the miso-factory messiah duo Seki and Satchan, both of whom, in actuality, play pivotal roles in completing Goodnight Punpun's story, especially on that 7th of July.

On further revisions, it came to be realized that my previous intentions were unfound at best. It could be of any interpretations, but surely Inio was not inspired by western mysticism or any suchlikes. Messias is a fancy term for any idealistic individuals ever in storytelling. 

I believe that 

, a literary approach that glorifies a personal spirit often through the portrayal of active characters that mature and overcome a long-standing struggle or opposing force - the drive of most narratives

where characters are instead passive and do succumb to the outside forces,

Unlike others, they have no gods. They're the most successful people in this series.

\# It's unknown how much Inio's life has influenced his decision-making when it comes down to these characters, as knowing this should make the big picture even more coherent. As much as I want it, reading Inio's other works, including his previous hit *Solanin*, may require a great deal of spare time and effort, but the rushing situation that I'm in unfortunately renders this impossible. And even if this is to be overcome, who knows how much it could be obtained from merely skimming over a man's profile. So perhaps there'll be a second part where I correct this review, when more insightful comparisons are made possible. For now, this serves as my interpretation alone.

Unlike the desperate Onodera and Tanaka, , while not receiving any better fates (and not being a couple), are portrayed as the other extremes: idealized figures who were just as misled.

and no modern work of art I promise could rival those of manga writer Inio Asano's in ferrying just that. This testament

a saving figure. Christian Mysticism. Shawshank Redemption. Forrest Gump. Romanticism

realism. Joker

The bright and dark sides of all characters. Humanity at the cost of respect and disgust.

dialogues from the guiding figures are drawn in black boxes

Seki - follows a life of self-guidance. challenge: distraction, aberration, lack of real ambitions or achievements, assholic acquaintances. advantage: self-growth in endurance and code. To be blunt, his lifestyle was arresting to those who've been chained away for too long. 

Satchan - determined, probably the most rightfully successful character. sympathetic: willingly sacrifice her name and reputation to help others. Even if it was revealed that her sympathy may stem from self-centeredness, glorifying herself and degrading punpun so as to be a guiding figure, the length she goes to to redeem herself serves as her redeeming feature.

always believe themselves to be superior, selfishly love others.

(disclaimer, I hate categorizing) (definition here) (FLCL, lll)

NGE?

Yet these figures are far and few between, and in the realistic Japan that is in Goodnight Punpun, they succumb to all sorts of concussions. The same world as in Joker. Interesting, in one of Tanaka's dream sequences, the textbooks that are her betty noires made references to the going state of the world, including politics, science, society, ... all of which were enmeshed into poppycocks. What could be deduced, you might have guessed that out.
